# Pokemon Macro Bot

An automated Pokemon catching bot that uses screen capture and OCR to detect Pokemon and execute catch sequences.

## üöÄ Features

- **Smart Attack/Catch System**: Attacks Pokemon first to lower HP, then attempts multiple catches
- **Encounter Tracking**: Avoids repeating attacks on the same Pokemon
- **Anti-Detection**: Randomized timing, rest breaks, and human-like behavior
- **OCR-Based Detection**: Uses screen capture and text recognition (no memory hacking)
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Track success rates and Pokemon catch counts
- **Configurable**: Easily customize for different games and setups

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.11+ (tested with 3.11.9)
- Tesseract OCR
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/pokemon-macro-bot.git
   cd pokemon-macro-bot
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv pokemon-macro-env
   # On Windows:
   pokemon-macro-env\Scripts\activate
   # On Linux/Mac:
   source pokemon-macro-env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Tesseract OCR**
   - Windows: Download from [UB-Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - Linux: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`
   - Mac: `brew install tesseract`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Copy the configuration template**

   ```bash
   cp config_template.py config.py
   ```

2. **Find your screen coordinates**

   ```bash
   python screen_helper.py
   ```

   Use this tool to find the exact coordinates where Pokemon names appear on your screen.

3. **Customize settings in config.py**
   - Set your target Pokemon list
   - Configure screen coordinates
   - Set key sequences for your game
   - Adjust timing and behavior settings

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Open your Pokemon game**
2. **Position the game window** where the bot can capture Pokemon names
3. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
